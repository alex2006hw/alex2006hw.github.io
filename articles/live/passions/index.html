<p><img src="/images/passion4travel.jpg" alt="passion4travel" title="" /></p>

<p>I have this passion to travel and I am going to make that my&nbsp;life.</p>

<h4>It is always time or&nbsp;money.</h4>

<p>Most of my time, I either have the time or money.  The windows where I have time <span class="caps">AND</span> money are dimishingly small.  I want to increase this window to the point where it is the&nbsp;majority.</p>

<p>The reason that Time-or-Money (ToM) is a problem for me is because someone else has always been controlling my&nbsp;ToM.</p>

<p>During the &#8216;recession&#8217; of 2000&#8217;s, I&#8217;ve found myself between jobs.  This gave me the opportunity to re-exam my life.  I&#8217;ve found that there is a direct correllation between time and money in my life.  Most of the time, I have the money but, not the time.  From as far back as I can remember, I have been trained by school-family-society that success in life depends on how much money one has.  I&#8217;ve spent most of my waking hour trying to measure my success by this&nbsp;yard-stick.</p>

<p>I was happy.  The happiness of ignorance.  It is a close loop feed back system I was in.  Others around me use the same measurement stick and seemed happy.  I was&nbsp;happy.</p>

<p>Upon reflections, I found that I was not happy.  I was content.  I was docile.  Life comes at me and I navigate it according to the measurements of my&nbsp;yard-stick.</p>

<p>I was unhappy with the way I measure my life.  Through some consequences, I was able to remove money from my measurements.  What I have left was time.  This is novel, this is new, I now have time to live my&nbsp;life.</p>

<h5>What Am I to do with all this&nbsp;time.</h5>

<p>I need to re-define myself using my new&nbsp;yard-stick.</p>

<p>I did not worry about money when I was living at home.  My parents took care of&nbsp;that.</p>

<p>I had live life according to a single&nbsp;rule:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have fun.  No&nbsp;drama.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Selfish&nbsp;individuals</h5>

<p>But, I found that &#8216;Have fun. No drama&#8217; produces selfish&nbsp;people!</p>

<p>I remember; If it is not fun.  I will not do it.  Negative drama , I will not do it.  I was selfish.  It was all about&nbsp;me.</p>

<h5>Rules are&nbsp;needed</h5>

<p>A rule for more&nbsp;empathy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>live, learn,&nbsp;grow</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>live : don&#8217;t be a wall flower.  Contribute and be&nbsp;involved.</li>
<li>learn : reflect on the events from living and try understand&nbsp;them</li>
<li>grow : using what I learn to make my life more&nbsp;possitive</li>
</ul>
